# gslices

## Overview

This is my own `slices` package for Go, because I don't like the [stdlib API](https://pkg.go.dev/slices).

Please consider using the stdlib package or make your own wrapper instead of using this package.

The `g` prefix implies a strong connection with my other game development packages, like [gsignal](https://github.com/quasilyte/gsignal).
It's not a coincidence, I'm using this library for game development which implies that I'm willing to prioritize its needs over anything else.
But unlike other g-packages, there is a standard library alternative. Therefore, I can't recommend using it to anyone apart from myself.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/quasilyte/gslices
```
